Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a BERT transformer model for sentiment analysis. The model classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using transfer learning with Hugging Face‚Äôs transformers library.

üìå Project Overview

Model: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Task: Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification)

Approach: Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model

Frameworks: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers

This project covers the end-to-end workflow:

Data Preprocessing ‚Äì Clean & tokenize text using BERT tokenizer

Model Fine-tuning ‚Äì Train BERT with classification head

Evaluation ‚Äì Accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Inference ‚Äì Make predictions on custom text inputs
